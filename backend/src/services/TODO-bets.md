Incomplete Balance Tracking: In the logTransaction call (around line 247), preBonusBalance and postBonusBalance are hardcoded to 0 with comments indicating they "would need actual pre/post bonus balances." This is not a bug but an incomplete implementation that could lead to inaccurate transaction logs if bonus balances are involved.

Commented-Out Error Handling: There are several commented-out return statements in error handling blocks (e.g., lines 142-149 and 155-169). While not causing runtime issues, this dead code should be removed for cleaner maintainability.

Health Check Logic: In checkWalletService (line 495), the function calls getUserWallets with a test user ID and assumes success if no exception is thrown, but it doesn't validate the returned data. If getUserWallets returns an empty array for non-existent users (which seems likely based on the main code's logic), this check might pass even if the service has issues. Consider adding a check like if (wallets.length === 0) return false; to ensure the service returns expected data.

Performance Placeholder: In getBetProcessingStats (line 428), averageProcessingTime is hardcoded to 150 ms as a placeholder. This should be replaced with actual calculation logic once processing times are logged in transactions.
