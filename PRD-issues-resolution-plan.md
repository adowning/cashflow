# Critical Issues Resolution Plan - Bet Orchestration Service

## Executive Summary

This focused plan addresses the **3 highest-priority critical issues** identified in the bet orchestration system that pose the highest risk to data integrity and system reliability. These issues could cause data corruption and financial discrepancies if not addressed immediately.

**Key Objectives:**
- Eliminate data corruption risks in transaction statistics
- Fix runtime errors in mixed balance handling
- Improve accuracy of balance tracking in audits

**Timeline:** 5 days focused implementation
**Estimated Effort:** 30 developer hours
**Risk Level:** Medium (requires database migration)
**Success Criteria:** All critical issues resolved, no data corruption, accurate financial tracking

## Critical Issues Resolution

### Issue 1: Transaction Statistics Calculation (Data Corruption Risk)
**Problem:** SQL query assumes 'WIN' transaction types and `status` field, but transaction-logging only stores 'BET'/'BONUS' types. `amount` represents winAmount, not wager amounts.

**Root Cause:** Schema mismatch between transaction logging and statistics calculation.

**Impact:** Corrupted analytics, incorrect GGR reporting, compliance violations.

**Solution:**
- Add `wagerAmount` and `status` fields to transaction schema
- Introduce 'WIN' transaction type for wins
- Update SQL queries to use correct field mappings

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Create database migration to add `wagerAmount`, `status` fields
2. Update `transaction-logging.service.ts` to log 'WIN' transactions
3. Modify `getBetProcessingStats` SQL queries
4. Update transaction summary calculations

**Timeline:** 2 days
**Resources:** Backend Developer (2 days), DBA (1 day)
**Risks:** Database migration complexity
**Mitigation:** Feature flags, rollback scripts

### Issue 3: Mixed Balance Type Handling (Runtime Errors)
**Problem:** 'mixed' balance type not handled in winnings addition, causing incorrect crediting.

**Root Cause:** Incomplete logic for proportional balance crediting.

**Impact:** Wrong balance updates, user disputes.

**Solution:**
- Implement proportional crediting logic for mixed deductions
- Calculate real vs bonus ratios for winnings distribution

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Modify `addWinnings` call in `processBet` for mixed balances
2. Implement ratio calculation based on deduction amounts
3. Add proportional crediting to real and bonus balances
4. Update balance tracking in transaction logging

**Timeline:** 2 days
**Resources:** Backend Developer (2 days)
**Risks:** Complex balance calculations
**Mitigation:** Unit tests with multiple scenarios

### Issue 4: Balance Tracking in Transaction Logging (Data Inaccuracy)
**Problem:** Pre/post bonus balance calculations incomplete, ignoring conversions.

**Root Cause:** Manual balance calculation instead of querying actual balances.

**Impact:** Inaccurate audit logs, compliance issues.

**Solution:**
- Pass actual balance data from deduction results to logging
- Query balances dynamically instead of manual calculation

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Modify `logTransaction` call to use balanceDeduction result data
2. Update balance calculation logic to include conversions
3. Add balance validation before logging
4. Implement balance reconciliation checks

**Timeline:** 1 day
**Resources:** Backend Developer (1 day)
**Risks:** Performance impact from additional queries
**Mitigation:** Cache balance data

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
1. **Database Migration:** Potential data loss
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive backups, staging testing

### Medium Risk
1. **Balance Calculations:** Financial discrepancies
   - Mitigation: Extensive testing, audit logging

## Success Criteria

- ✅ Zero data corruption incidents

### Compliance
- ✅ Accurate GGR calculations
- ✅ Complete audit trails for financial transactions

## Monitoring and Validation

### Key Metrics
- Bet processing success rate (>99.9%)
- Balance discrepancy incidents (0)
- Transaction logging accuracy (100%)

### Validation Approach
- Automated testing with 100% coverage
- Staging environment regression testing
- Production monitoring for 48 hours post-deployment

This focused plan ensures the most critical data integrity and financial tracking issues are resolved while maintaining system stability.
